In this project the main purpose is to develop an accurate accident detection and reporting system utilizing
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) within the domain of deep learning. The project revolves around the
analysis of accident and non -accident datasets for detection of accident from the video footage.
CNN model developed here can
1.detect live accident
2.Provide an alert message which includes exact time date and location of the incident to the most
proximate control room so the rescue becomes very fast
3.Alert messages will be sent to selected contacts to inform about accident
Successful implementation of this CNN-based approach has the potential to accurately detect the accident.
Future work may involve refining the model architecture and exploring additional avenues for improving
predictive accuracy.
